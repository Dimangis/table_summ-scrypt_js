# table_summ-scrypt_js
My task is:

Write a JavaScript function that accepts an element that is a table (<"table">) and an array containing the column numbers of the table. For each of the columns contained in the array:
If a table column with this number contains numeric data, calculate the sum of all the elements of this column 
If a table column contains at least one value that is not a number, count the number of NON-EMPTY values in this column
Add a row to the end of the table in which, for each of the columns passed to the function, output either the sum of the column (for numeric data) or the number of non-empty elements.
